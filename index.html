            <P>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It achieves this by adding new HTML elements while modifying existing ones. Many coders enhance web development skills using JavaScript to create user-friendly and interactive websites.
                JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games. It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.
